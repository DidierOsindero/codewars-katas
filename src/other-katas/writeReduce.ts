// Write a function that behaves like array.reduce (but which takes the array as one of its arguments)

// Assume the initial value of the accumulator will always be provided (particularly if you are attempting this kata in typescript)

// export const reduce = (inputArray: number [], callback: () => string | number) {

// }
